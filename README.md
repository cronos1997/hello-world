# hello-world
just another repository

Hi there. 

I am not so bright and tough when it comes to coding.
But i like to learn new things till i become master of that thing.
Then I move to find another topic.
Right now my first priority is c++.
Help me to become a pro.

Thanks to all of you who reads this.
